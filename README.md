# Effective-Drag-Coefficient-Prediction-on-Single-View-2D-Images
Code for the prediction of the drag coefficient of falling snowflakes given the 2D snowflake image, the shape class, and the Reynolds Number. The model is trained on the Locatelli and Hobbs dataset. Repository contains necessary files to remove the background on the image and process data with the machine learning model to replicate results.

# Use Case
One can replicate the results found in Effective Drag Coefficient Prediction on Single-View 2D-Images paper that used feature extraction algorithm KCPA to extract meaningful features from single-view 2D-images of falling snowflakes. The images are passed through remove_background.py that removes the background and border of the snowflake images. The images are then passed through KPCA.ipynb to extract meaningful features from the images. One can extract a number of features from the snowflake iamges, but 1, 3, and 5 were tested. See Paper for results. One can then pass through the data outputted by KPCA.ipynb to run against machine learning methods: random forest, XGBoost, and MLP models. An ensemble MLP mehtod showed to be the best model with MSE loss.
